**What Is DeFi? Understanding Decentralized Finance**
* **[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/defi-decentralized-finance/)**

A financial **asset** is essentially any property that holds economic value. 
**Securities**, on the other hand, are a specific type of financial asset that can be easily traded and have a defined monetary value.

Security can be a type of asset. (Stocks, loans can be a security since its easily tradable and holds monetary, versus a building would be an asset and not secuirty cause its not a financial instrument and not easy to trade but still an asset).

NUCs are great for most stakers that only run a few validators because of their low maintenance, low monthly running costs, and ease of setup.

Go through each hardware setup with Parth and determine if hes looking for long term

https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/local/hardware.html#drez-s-laptop


Are looking for something longterm I assume?
Is there a budget for pc parts (I assume there isn't)?
Would you prefer building a PC or using a NUC, UCs are great for most stakers that only run a few validators because of their low maintenance, low monthly running costs, and ease of setup. However we can't upgrade them and we would have to by a new setup all together if we want to ugprade the node..
